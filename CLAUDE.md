## agent-ci

- Use `npx @redwoodjs/agent-ci run --quiet --workflow .github/workflows/<workflow-name>.yml` to run CI locally
- When a step fails, the run pauses automatically. Use `npx @redwoodjs/agent-ci retry --name <runner>` to retry after fixing the failure
- Do NOT push to trigger remote CI when agent-ci can run it locally — it's instant and free
- CI was green before you started. Any failure is caused by your changes — do not assume pre-existing failures
- Use `--no-matrix` to collapse matrix jobs into a single run when you don't need full matrix coverage
